I made the corrections as suggested("https://github.com/AMJ-dev/Tahoe_update/blob/main/specials/INSTALL_UBUNTU.rst").
I found out that Tahoe supports the following OS and distros(I found this from the CircleCI pipeline):
Ubuntu 20.04
Ubuntu 18.04
Ubuntu 16.04
Fedora 29
Fedora 28
Debian 9
Debian 10
CentOS 8
windows
OS-X
Nevertheless, I do not think the current installation guide here  covers the installation procedures, and guidelines for new Tahoe users to be able to run Tahoe conveniently across these distros and Operating Systems.
I have started writing installation instructions for theses distros and operating systems.
I am yet to commit any work done because I am yet to test the installation procedures being written.
I believe new users will find it easier to run Tahoe if we have more detailed guidelines.
