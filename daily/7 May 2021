Ubuntu 20.04 comes with python 3 installed
Tahoe-lafs users will have to install python2 and switch to python 2 to be able to run tahoe, you can swicth to python 3 whenever you need to use python 3.
The following instructions are for installing tahoe on ubuntu20.04
1.  Install python 2
sudo apt install python2

2.  Once the installation complete, you can check the Python 2 and python 3 version using the “–version” command.

python2 --version
python3 --version

3.   Check all the available Python versions in your system.

ls /usr/bin/python*

4. Check whether there are any Python-alternatives configured.

sudo update-alternatives --list python


5. Configure two Python alternatives. From the Step above, depending on the version of python in your system we will set our priority.

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2 1
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 2

6. Confirm if the Python alternatives are set and whether they are in use.

sudo update-alternatives --config python

7. Check the Python version currently running on the system.(it should show python 2)

python --version

8. Install everything needed to run Tahoe. On a modern Debian/Ubuntu-derived distribution, this command will get you everything you need:

apt-get install build-essential python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev virtualenv

9. Confirm Pip works. Many Python installations already include pip, but in case yours does not, 
get pip for python 2 with: 'curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py' and run 'python get-pip.py'

pip --version

10. Confirm if Virtualenv works. virtualenv. If you do not have an OS-provided copy of virtualenv, install it with the instructions from the virtualenv documentation:

virtualenv --version

11. Install the Latest Tahoe-LAFS Release
We recommend creating a fresh virtualenv for your Tahoe-LAFS install, to isolate it from any python packages that are already installed (and to isolate the rest of your system from Tahoe’s dependencies).

This example uses a virtualenv named venv, but you can call it anything you like. Many people prefer to keep all their virtualenvs in one place, like ~/.local/venvs/ or ~/venvs/.

It’s usually a good idea to upgrade the virtualenv’s pip and setuptools to their latest versions, with venv/bin/pip install -U pip setuptools. Many operating systems have an older version of virtualenv, which then includes older versions of pip and setuptools. Upgrading is easy, and only affects the virtualenv: not the rest of your computer.

Then use the virtualenv’s pip to install the latest Tahoe-LAFS release from PyPI with venv/bin/pip install tahoe-lafs. After installation, run venv/bin/tahoe --version to confirm the install was successful:

% virtualenv venv
New python executable in ~/venv/bin/python2.7
