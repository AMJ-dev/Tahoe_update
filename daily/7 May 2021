I Resolved Ubuntu 20.04 installation issue.
Created an new instruction guide here: https://github.com/AMJ-dev/Tahoe_update/blob/main/specials/INSTALL_UBUNTU, although I am yet to create a PR.
I made a comment here: https://www.tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/3696#comment:11 and waiting for meejah's response before I make a PR.

Lessons:
Running tahoe on python 2 will keep getting tougher as many packages have evolved and focused on python 3. 

Queestions: 
How many OS and linux distributions are supported by tahoe ?
Do the current Installation instructions support all these OS and distros?

Suggestions:
We may need to write OS and distro specific instructions for tahoe installation and setup in order to encourage new users of tahoe.
